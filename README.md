# Checked
This was my first app I made with Swift and SwiftUI. It's a **To Do List App** but more complex and with a clean look. I worked on this app for about a month and half, it connects to **Firebase** and Firestore to save all the user information such as Auth credentials and every item added in the app.

# Overall
The app is responsive and fast, it's available on both iPad and iPhone devices. And of course, it has support for **Dark Mode** as well!

# Features
The screenshots here depict the other **native davice capabilities** the app offers, like Sheets, Haptic Touch, Device Notifications, preferred in-app Theme, Language selection and more!

# Work in progress
The app is not over yet. It's still missing a lot of features, such as cloud storage for images, account deletion, shared events and more. To see what's coming on this app please check the official website for the full changelog and future updates.
